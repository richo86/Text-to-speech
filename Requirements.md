## üß© **Core Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Frontend (Angular)**
- **User Authentication**: Login/signup, session management.
- **Audio Input Interface**:
  - Upload audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3).
  - Record audio directly in the browser.
- **Text Input Interface**:
  - Text box for entering the text to be synthesized.
- **Audio Playback**:
  - Play generated audio.
  - Download option for synthesized audio.
- **History/Library** (optional): Show past uploads and generated audio.

### 2. **Backend (Python, FastAPI)**
- **API Endpoints**:
  - Upload audio.
  - Record audio (if handled server-side).
  - Submit text for synthesis.
  - Return generated audio.
- **Audio Processing**:
  - Preprocessing uploaded audio (e.g., trimming, normalization).
  - Voice cloning or embedding extraction.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine**:
  - Use models like Coqui TTS, OpenVoice, or Whisper + Bark.
- **Storage**:
  - Store uploaded audio and generated files (local or cloud).
- **Database**:
  - User data, audio metadata, history.

## üß† **AI/ML Requirements**

- **Voice Cloning / Embedding**:
  - Extract speaker embeddings from uploaded/recorded audio.
- **Text-to-Speech Generation**:
  - Use the embeddings + input text to generate speech.
- **Model Hosting**:
  - Host models locally or use services like Hugging Face Inference API or Replicate.

## üîê **Security & Compliance**

- Secure file uploads (sanitize inputs).
- Rate limiting for API usage.
- GDPR compliance if storing user data.
- HTTPS for secure communication.


## üöÄ MVP Overview

### üéØ **Goal**:
Allow users to:
1. Upload or record a voice sample.
2. Input text.
3. Generate speech using the uploaded voice.

## üß© MVP Architecture

### üîπ **Frontend (Angular)**

Responsive layout: Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Modern components: Clean, intuitive UI with animations and feedback.
Attractive styling: Use a design system like Material Design or Tailwind CSS.

- **Components**:
  - `UploadComponent`: Upload or record audio.
  - `TextInputComponent`: Input text to synthesize.
  - `AudioPlayerComponent`: Play generated audio.
- **Services**:
  - `ApiService`: Communicate with Python backend.

### üîπ **Backend (Python + FastAPI)**
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /upload`: Accept audio file.
  - `POST /synthesize`: Accept text + reference audio, return generated audio.
- **TTS Engine**:
  - Coqui TTS with speaker embedding support.

## üì¶ MVP File Flow

1. **User uploads/records audio** ‚Üí Angular sends to `/upload`.
2. **User enters text** ‚Üí Angular sends to `/synthesize` with audio reference.
3. **Backend uses Coqui TTS** ‚Üí Generates audio.
4. **Angular receives audio** ‚Üí Plays it in browser.
